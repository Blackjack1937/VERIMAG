# Implementing the RL-Based Attack Strategy

## 1. Overview

Now that we have formalized the RL-based attack model, the next step is to implement a **modular RL environment** and test our first RL agent. This document outlines the structure of our implementation, breaking it down into the following key tasks:

1. **Building the RL Environment**: Separating the target program from the attacker.
2. **Implementing the RL Agent**: Choosing the first RL model (Q-Learning, DQN, or MCTS).
3. **Evaluating the Results**: Comparing RL performance against previous random search benchmarks.

## 2. Implementing the RL Environment

We need to create an environment where the attacker can interact with the target program in a **controlled and modular way**. This involves:

### **2.1 Separating the Target Program**

- The **target program** will be treated as a **black-box function** that takes inputs `(x, y)` and returns an outcome (success/fail or numerical score).
- We will **not modify the target program** but expose an interface that the attacker can use.
- The environment will manage **execution state `(σ, l)`**, keeping track of program execution progress.

### **2.2 Defining the State Representation (`σ, l`)**

- `σ`: Internal state (variable values, memory, control flow history).
- `l`: Execution progress (instruction pointer, control-flow graph position).
- We may need an **abstraction layer** if full state tracking is too complex.

### **2.3 Handling Randomness (`y_r`, `y_c`)**

- **Fixed randomness (`y_r`)** should remain constant per execution.
- **Changing randomness (`y_c`)** should reset at every new attempt.
- The environment should allow RL models to **learn stable properties of `y_r` while adapting to `y_c`**.

### **2.4 Managing Loops and Execution Flow**

- Decide whether to **explicitly model loops** or **abstract them**.
- Implement a mechanism for **state tracking across multiple steps**.

## 3. Implementing the RL Agent

### **3.1 Choosing the First RL Model**

We will start with **Q-Learning** as a simple baseline. If necessary, we will switch to **DQN or MCTS**.

- **Q-Learning:**
  - Suitable for small state-action spaces.
  - Uses a Q-table to update action values based on rewards.
- **DQN (Deep Q-Network):**
  - Uses a neural network to approximate Q-values.
  - Handles larger state-action spaces.
- **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search):**
  - Best suited for **sequential attack planning**.
  - Evaluates multiple future attack paths before choosing an action.

### **3.2 Training the RL Agent**

- The agent will iteratively try attacks and **update its policy based on rewards**.
- The goal is to **maximize exploitation probability** while minimizing unnecessary actions.

## 4. Evaluating the RL Approach

### **4.1 Comparing with Previous Methods**

We will benchmark RL against:

- **Random search** (our previous approach).
- **Biased sampling** (where `x=42` was prioritized).

Key metrics:

- **Time to first successful exploit**.
- **Learning efficiency** (how many attempts until a stable attack strategy emerges).
- **Adaptability** (handling randomness in the target program).

### **4.2 Iterating on the Model**

If the RL approach struggles with certain challenges (e.g., too large state space, unstable learning), we will:

- Adjust the **reward function**.
- Improve **state representation** (simplify or add abstraction).
- Switch RL models (e.g., from Q-Learning to DQN or MCTS).

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Build the RL environment** with a modular interface for the target program.
2. **Implement the first RL agent (Q-Learning)** and test its performance.
3. **Compare RL results with random search and refine the approach**.
